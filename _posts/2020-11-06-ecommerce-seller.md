# E-Commerce Seller Performance Prediction

### <a href="https://ecommerce-seller-prediction.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Deployed Model</a>


## Summary

We take on a role of a team of data scientists at Olist, an online e-commerce company that connects small businesses from all over Brazil to large online e-commerce marketplaces such as [Mercado Livre](https://www.mercadolivre.com.br/) and [Americanas](https://www.americanas.com.br/).

By listing their products on Olist Store, small business owners are able to sell their products to customers on these marketplaces without the prohibitive costs of maintaining a vendor presence there.

The project focused on how we can use sample e-commerce data to increase the number of sellers and provide recommendations to them. 

The final model predicts seller performance based on seller and product features, where the decision tree-based Random Forest algorithm was leveraged. 

Translation, word tokenization and topic modeling was also performed on the dataset of Portuguese reviews.

## Problem Statement
Based on the data we've gathered from the sales and reviews on the platform, we have been tasked to estimate the sales that a seller can get based on factors such as their product category, average product price and location.

Additionally, we also want to take a look at the reviews to give potential sellers advice on how to increase customer satisfaction.

Our guiding questions are:
- How much can a seller expect to earn on the platform?
- What steps can a seller take to increase their sales?
- What are the prominent topics that feature in our customer reviews?

## Analysis

###  Data Processing and Cleaning

The data was cleaned and processed before analysis could take place. Our data was provided to us in eight separate datasets.

![datasets]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ecommerce-capstone/datasets-summary.png)

These datasets needed to be joined along unique customer, order and seller ids to create a master order list that could be aggregated.

The processing included removing orders that were cancelled or had ambiguous order statuses, as well as feature engineering to create variables for delivery time and difference in delivery estimates.

The full approach is outlined in the code notebooks on Github. 

### Key Insights and Visualisations

The product categories which generated the highest sales value tended to be those with the highest sales in general (health and beauty, bed bath and table, sports leisure). However, we also see the watches_gifts category perform well in sales value although being seventh in terms of sales count.

The mean sale prices, total sale orders, total sales value and number of unique products per category have been combined in the interactive plot here:

By joining our order and seller data with our location data, we were also able to see the areas with the highest order values, where we see that most orders come from the southeastern coast, concentrated in Sao Paulo and Rio, two of Brazil's largest cities.

This trend was also reflected in the number of sellers and seller performance in these areas.

This provided us indication that the location and product categories would have an impact on the sales generated by sellers.

### Modeling Approach

Due to the unlikelihood that the variables would be related linearly to the target variable of average sales per month, we focused largely on the Random Forest algorithim and Gradient Booster. The data was split into training and validation sets, where both algorithms were tuned using gridsearch and evaluated on root mean squared error.

The final model selected was based on the Random Forest, which had a slightly higher RMSE but was giving realistic results as the Gradient Booster was returning negative values, which would not be fruitful for our use case.

## Conclusion and Insights

![predictions]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ecommerce-capstone/prediction.png)

We were able to build a predictive model for predicting seller performance with around R$200 of root mean squared error and an adjusted R2 score of 0.93. However, as the data is not completely comprehensive, the model will require additional training on more data to be sufficiently robust and to evaluate its reproducibility.

The model predicts seller performances by taking in the following information:

- Product Category
- State
- Min, Max, Average Product Price
- Number of Products they can sell in a month
- Number of Unique Products

Average products they can sell in a month turned out to be the most predictive factor, along with the minimum, maximum and average product prices. With more data and potentially more inputs from the seller like the size of their company, length of seller relationship to Olist, we may want to also try predicting optimal product volume that can be sold instead, in the long run.
