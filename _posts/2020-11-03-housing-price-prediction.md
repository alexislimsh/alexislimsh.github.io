Based on the Boston, Ames housing dataset, I predicted sale price by shortlisting top explanatory variables from over 80 categorical, ordinal, discrete and continuous variables using correlation.

# Model Prediction of Housing Sale Price

## Executive Summary

When it comes to housing prices, we often have access to extensive past data around housing features and the eventual sale price. Being able to predict future sale prices within a reasonable margin would be incredibly useful to many stakeholders, including housing agents, governing bodies and even residents themselves.

In this project, we process the Ames train and test datasets obtained via the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsi-us-6-project-2-regression-challenge) hosted by General Assembly to find a robust model based on 25-30 variables for prediction of house sale price. We look at which features affect sale price the most through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, and build and refine our model using various regression techniques.

The data documentation for the original dataset can be viewed [here](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt).

## Problem Statement

What features of a house contribute most significantly to its eventual sale price, and with knowledge of these features, how can we predict future sale price? Can the model that we build be generalised to other cities, states and countries?

We approach the problem statement from the POV of a team of housing agents in Ames, Iowa, as itâ€™s likely that agents will have access to this level of detail about a property. Having a model will help agents to consistently valuate properties and negotiate better between buyers and sellers. If successful, this model could also then be marketed to both governing bodies and housing agents who would be interested in such a tool.

*Target Variable*
![salepriceplot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/housing-boston-prediction/saleprice-plot.png)

Looking at our target variable, it is right-skewed and many outliers have been detected by the boxplot. There are no null values, so we won't have to worry about using it in our model.

**Features**

Processing and EDA of the variable types were done according to their feature types i.e. Nominal, Ordinal, Continuous and Discrete. The codebook contains the full process of how each variable was evaluated and shortlisted or rejected. Here is a brief overview:

*Nominal*
Any nominal variables we included in our model needed to be one-hot encoded for each category. Hence, we prioritized variables that have a clear impact on the sale price, looping through the variables to calculate the correlation and record one-hot encoded variables that fulfill the following:

- They had more than an absolute value of 0.3
- They constitute more than 5% of the total entries

```python
# Code to shorlist nominal features (the variable nominal is a list consisting of all names of nominal features)

nominal_dummies = []
for var in nominal:
    value_c = df[var].value_counts(normalize=True).sort_index() #Get the normalized value counts for the variable
    dummy_df = pd.get_dummies(df[var],prefix=var) #One-hot encode variable
    dummy_df = dummy_df.join(df['saleprice']) #Add sale price to one-hot encoded values
    dummy_corr = dummy_df.corr(method='spearman') #Calculate correlation for one-hot encoded values with saleprice
    for i, value in enumerate(dummy_corr['saleprice']): #Loop through saleprice correlations to check for suitable nominal variables
        variable_cat = dummy_corr.index[i]
        if var != 'saleprice' and variable_cat != 'saleprice': #Rule out saleprice correlation (will be 1.0)
            counts = value_c[i]
            if abs(value) >= 0.3 and counts >= 0.05: #Check to see if correlation is more than 0.3 and value counts are sufficient
                entry = {}
                entry['variable'] = var
                entry['var_category'] = variable_cat
                entry['correlation'] = value
                entry['value_counts'] = counts
                nominal_dummies.append(entry) #Add dictionary for variable category to our list

```

We also looked at the boxplots for each of the nominal variables.

![nominalplot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/housing-boston-prediction/nominal_boxplots.png)

Looking at the boxplots and nominal_corr_df table, we can see that for the variables identified with higher correlations, we can see some differentiation in terms of sale price values. 

*Ordinal*

Ordinal variables had to be first mapped to numerical values. For example:

```python

df['exter_qual'] = df['exter_qual'].map({'Po':1,'Fa':2,'TA':3,'Gd':4,'Ex':5})
```
![ordinalreg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/housing-boston-prediction/ordinal_reg.png)

Based on the plots and correlation scores, these features were shortlisted: 
```python
'overall_qual',
 'exter_qual',
 'bsmt_qual',
 'bsmt_exposure',
 'bsmtfin_type_1',
 'heating_qc',
 'electrical',
 'kitchen_qual',
 'fireplace_qu',
 'garage_finish',
 'garage_qual',
 'garage_cond',
 'paved_drive'
 ```

The discrete and continuous features were also evaluated according to boxplot and correlation scores, where we also combined certain features e.g. house age by subtracting the year built from the year sold.

### 2. Modeling & Tuning

We split our data into a train and test validation set before proceeding with the modeling. The Linear Regression, Lasso and Ridge models were tested on the data, where we also used PolynomialFeatures to combine our top-performing features.

These features were then reduced to 30 features with the use of RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination).

The model was evaluated by submitting a csv submission to kaggle, which scores the data on mean squared error.

The final model selected was a ridge model with a private and public score of 30,027 and 28,062 respectively, which is relatively better compared to the baseline model's score around 80,000.

### 3. Interpretation

To evaluate our model, we look at the residual error of the predicted values (this is validated on our test dataset that was created initially).

![residuals]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/housing-boston-prediction/residuals.png)

It looks like as sale price increases, we tend to get a higher range of error. This indicates that the model may not be as useful for predicting sale price beyond a certain number, where other factors not available in the dataset may be affecting the target.

![coefficients]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/housing-boston-prediction/coefficients.png)

We can see that the features with the top 3 highest coefficient scores are all features based on total_sf. This feature continues to show up in the other coefficients, and is in 50% of our top 10 features. Interestingly, this variable was created from other square-foot values in the dataset, which shows us the importance of feature engineering.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

We have successfully built a model with a relatively good RMSE based on the training dataset provided, and our examination has indicated that while the top influencing factor appears to be area (total square feet of the house and individual areas), variables across different aspects of the house were also picked out by the model to be significant.

### Recommendations

If we had additional time and resources, we may want to consider the following to improve on and continually iterate on our model:

- The frequency distribution of the log of sale prices follows a normal distribution. By building our linear regression model with the log of sale prices, we can better fit and predict the sale prices of houses in the higher price range.

- For features with many different categories, we can combine and regroup them so that each category becomes more significant. For eg: Neighborhood has 28 categories, we can regroup them into 5 categories based on their mean sale prices.

- We can also look into other external factors affecting housing prices like economic factors and demographic data of the community.

While we see that the model built has limitations, it is also true that the process of putting together the model is informative and a similar process can be conducted for other datasets in other cities or with different variables collected. Our process is as follows:

- Clean and process data
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Feature selection (by judgement and RFE and lasso techniques)
- Model iteration and optimisation

The last step should be ongoing if there is a stream of new data. Any model will have its limitations, but with the right set of assumptions and understanding of suitable use cases, we're able to predict meaningfully.
