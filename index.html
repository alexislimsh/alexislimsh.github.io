        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are a few projects I've done so far:</p>

        <div class="project">
          <a class="project-name" href="https://github.com/alexislimsh/dsiprojects/tree/master/capstone">E-Commerce Seller Performance Prediction</a>
          <p>Exploratory data analysis and seller performance prediction leveraging a sample of e-commerce data from Brazilian company Olist. 
            The model predicts seller performance based on seller and product features, where the decision tree-based Random Forest algorithm was leveraged. 
            The web app based on the final model is <a href="https://ecommerce-seller-prediction.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">deployed on Heroku.</a></p>
          <p>Translation, word tokenization and topic modeling was also performed on the dataset of Portuguese reviews.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
          <a class="project-name" href="https://github.com/alexislimsh/dsiprojects/tree/master/dsi-16-project-2">Housing Sale Price Prediction</a>
          <p>Based on the Boston, Ames housing dataset, I predicted sale price by shortlisting top explanatory variables
            from over 80 categorical, ordinal, discrete and continuous variables using correlation.</p>
          <p>The final model leveraged polynomial features, recursive feature elimination and regularization.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
          <a class="project-name" href="https://github.com/alexislimsh/dsiprojects/tree/master/dsi-16-project-4">EARLY DETECTION FOR WEST NILE VIRUS</a>
          <p>This was a group project that explored data on West Nile Virus infection in Chicago, building a model that
            predicted West Nile Virus presence based on location, date and weather metrics.</p>
          <p>The final model leveraged top explanatory variables shortlisted through cross-correlation maps and EDA,
            where the best model of 8 classification models tested was selected and tuned.</p>
